# Savings by Month Chart Not Displaying - Debugging Prompt

## Problem Statement
The Savings by Month chart on the Insights page is showing a placeholder message ("No savings data available") even though the backend is confirmed to be generating the data correctly. I've verified that the backend calculation in `backend/src/features/savingsAnalyzer.ts` is working - when I run database queries directly, I can see that `savingsByMonth` is being generated with 7 months of data (May-Nov 2025) showing realistic balances. The backend has been rebuilt (`npm run build`) and both dev servers are running. However, the frontend chart component in `frontend/src/pages/InsightsPage.tsx` is not rendering the data.

## What I Need You To Do
Please investigate why the frontend is not receiving or displaying the `savingsByMonth` data. Start by checking the browser's Network tab to inspect the `/api/profile/:userId` response and verify if `signals['30d'].savings.savingsByMonth` contains the expected data structure (an object with month keys like "2025-05", "2025-06", etc. and balance values). Then examine the chart rendering logic in `InsightsPage.tsx` around line 305-390 to see if the data is being filtered out incorrectly or if there's a conditional render preventing the chart from displaying. The frontend has debug logging enabled - look for `[Savings Chart] Filtering` messages in the browser console that show the filtering logic. Test with users `Lenna_Stiedemann73@hotmail.com` or `Aimee_Oberbrunner@gmail.com` who are confirmed to have savings data. I need you to identify whether the issue is: (1) API not returning the data, (2) frontend filtering removing all months, (3) chart component conditional logic preventing render, or (4) a TypeScript/React error. Once you identify the root cause, implement the fix.
