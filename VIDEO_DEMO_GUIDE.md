## Common Questions & Answers

**Q: Why don't persona scores add up to 100%?**
A: Persona scores are confidence/match scores (0.0-1.0), not percentages. A user can have a 50% match to High Utilization and a 30% match to Variable Income - these are independent confidence scores, not a distribution.

**Q: How many recommendations does each user get?**
A: 3-5 educational articles + 1-3 partner offers (enforced by the system).

**Q: Are recommendations diverse?**
A: Yes! The system ensures variety across signal categories (credit, subscription, savings, income) and considers both primary and secondary personas.

**Q: What if a user matches multiple personas?**
A: They get a primary persona (highest score) and potentially a secondary persona (if score ≥ 30%). Recommendations consider both for diversification.

**Q: How does the system handle flagged recommendations?**
A: Agentic review flags items with tone violations or eligibility issues. Operators can approve (show to user) or hide (remove from user) flagged items.
