# SpendSense Memory Bank

This folder contains comprehensive documentation of the SpendSense implementation, organized according to the Memory Bank structure pattern.

## File Structure

### Core Files
- **`projectbrief.md`** - Foundation document defining core requirements, goals, and project scope
- **`activeContext.md`** - Current work focus, recent changes, and next steps
- **`progress.md`** - What works, what's left to build, current status, and known issues
